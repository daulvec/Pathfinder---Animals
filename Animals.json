It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a standard treant, gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities). If the tobongo that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. Curse of Barkflesh (Su) Following a successful grapple, a tobongo can dig its spiky branches into its victim, infecting him with a foul and potent curse. Unless he succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save, the victim's flesh immediately begins to harden and grow uncontrollably like tree bark, and he takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage per day until his Dexterity reaches 0. At this point, the victim turns entirely stiff, grows roots, and transforms into a new, unintelligent tree, preventing any form of resurrection short of wish or miracle. The effect can be slowed by pruning the victim once per hour, slicing off the strange growths. Pruning inflicts 1d6 points of damage on the victim, but it negates the need to make a new Fortitude save. If the victim goes without pruning for more than an hour, the barkflesh takes over and he must immediately make the Fortitude save for the day or suffer the Dexterity damage. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Curse of Barkflesh: Grapple- injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d4 Dex damage, when Dex reaches 0, target transforms into a tree. Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A tobongo or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Shake the Earth (Ex) A rooted tobongo can, as a full-round action, uproot itself, buckling the surrounding earth in a 60-foot radius. Living creatures within the radius must make a DC 29 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d6 points of damage. Man-made structures within the area of effect must make a DC 29 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of structural damage. Once uprooted, the tobongo cannot use this action again until it re-roots itself. It takes the creature at least 1 hour to root effectively. The save DC is Strength-based. Treespeech (Ex) A tobongo has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet it with an attitude of friendly or helpful.",

A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.",

As a swift action, a jinmenju can alter the appearance of any of its head-fruits to take on the particular face of any creature the tree has seen or has memory of. If it cannot determine what kind of face or form would be most appealing to a particular target by using its share memory spell-like ability, a jinmenju makes its head-fruit take the appearance of a delicious-looking melon. A jinmenju can alter its head-fruits into any combination of up to a maximum of six faces or shapes at one time. Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a head-fruit must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be magically compelled to immediately grab the head-fruit and eat it as soon as possible. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's enticing head-fruits for 24 hours. A head-fruit removed from a jinmenju's branch retains some of the tree's magic and maintains its shape for 1d3 hours before reverting to its natural form. The save DC is Constitution-based. In addition to tasting terrible, a jinmenju's head-fruits are incredibly poisonous, and anyone who takes a bite out of one suffers from the following effect.  Head-Fruit Poison: Head-fruit-ingested; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 round; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Intoxicating Stench (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a jinmenju can cause its fruit to immediately begin to ferment, emitting an unnaturally sweet aroma in a 60- foot spread that draws creatures toward the tree. Once activated, the aroma persists for 6 rounds unless dispersed by moderate or stronger wind. All creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each round or become captivated. Once a creature becomes captivated, it takes no actions save to approach the jinmenju via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim that is attacked by the jinmenju gets a new saving throw as a free action during each of the jinmenju's attacks to overcome the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Unsettling Drone (Su) A jinmenju's numerous head-fruits emit a low, persistent hum that unnerves any living creature who hears it. Any creature within 30 feet of a jinmenju must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become shaken until it leaves the affected area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's unsettling drone for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The cocooned target cannot use Escape Artist to get out of the cocoon. Other creatures can aid the target by attacking the cocoon with piercing or slashing weapons, but the creature within takes half the damage from any attack against the cocoon. Once the cocoon is destroyed, it deflates and decays. Each creature swallowed by a moonflower is encased in its own cocoon.  Pod Spawn (Ex) Should a moonflower's pod prison kill and digest a Small or larger creature, the pod transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points after 1d4 hours.

Mirage (Su) A sargassum fiend emits a powerful scent that causes specific, miragelike hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a sargassum fiend must make a DC 18 Will save or become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured creature sees the monster as whatever would most compel it to approach. This might be a lost loved one, a child in need of help, an enchanting mermaid, the promise of dry land, and so on. The extent of this illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer.

A living topiary can use this ability three times per day. Move through Hedges (Ex) A living topiary may move through any solid object made of brambles or thick, porous plants without penalty. It must begin and end its turn outside of the object. Sculpt Shape (Ex) As a standard action, a living topiary can alter itself to take on the basic form of any creature.

Evisceration (Ex) A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or creatures it has grappled. When a mi-go makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check), it inflicts its sneak attack damage on the victim. A creature that takes this damage must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage as well from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based. Item Creation (Ex) All mi-go possess the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item-the resulting item is always mi-go technology (see facing page). Mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources-this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item. No Breath (Ex) A mi-go does not breathe, and is immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison). This does not give immunity to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing. Starflight (Su) A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)- provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.",

When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown mold), a calathgar gains fast healing 1. Mold Mulch (Ex) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is killed by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet of brown mold is cold enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and the persistent effect of its seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. See page 416 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for additional details. Seed Spray (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, up to 3 times per day, a calathgar can expel a blast of thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 15 for half ). In frigid climes-areas where the temperature is 40 degrees or colder-these seeds cling to those they strike, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on the following round.

The plant a leshy transforms into always looks the same and, despite being Small, is typically unusually large for a plant of its size. It is a swift action for a leshy to turn into or from a plant. Fungus leshys commonly turn into large mushrooms, puffballs, polypores, earthstars, or clumps of mold. Plantspeech (Ex) All leshys can speak with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, but only with species they're related to. Fungus leshys can communicate with molds and fungi as if they were plants. Spores (Ex) A fungus leshy is riddled with molds and spores. Anytime a fungus leshy takes damage, a cloud of spores bursts from its body, forcing all adjacent creatures to make a DC 14 Fortitude save or have their vision reduced to 10 feet for 1 minute. Spending a full-round action to wash one's eyes with water ends this effect. A fungus leshy may also spit a puffball riddled with spores as a ranged attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. Verdant Burst (Su) When slain, a fungus leshy explodes in a burst of fertile energies. All plant creatures within 30 feet of the slain leshy heal 1d8 points of damage.

      "SpecialAbilities": "Avoidance (Ex) When a mindslaver mold is infesting living or undead creature, it can make a Reflex save as an immediate action to completely avoid an attack that would normally have hit it. This attack instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.  Infestation (Su) A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot-square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on all Will saves made against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed.  Mold Mindlink (Su) A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other molds.  Spore Pod (Ex) A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment of 20 feet.  Spores (Su) Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self.

Each round this feeding continues, the sleeping victim can attempt a new DC 14 Will save to awaken. This save DC is Constitution-based.  Soporific Pollen (Ex) As a standard action, a xtabay can release sleep-inducing pollen into the air around it. Each creature within a 10-ft.-radius burst centered on the xtabay must make a DC 14 Will save or fall asleep for 1d3 minutes. A creature that succeeds on the Fortitude save cannot be affected by the same xtabay's soporific pollen for 24 hours. A creature put to sleep by this pollen can be awakened by vigorously shaking the sleeper (a standard action) or by damaging it. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Known for their potent-and ultimately deadly-scent, xtabays are a f loral hazard to the unwary.
