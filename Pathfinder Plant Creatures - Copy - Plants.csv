It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a standard treant, gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities). If the tobongo that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. Curse of Barkflesh (Su) Following a successful grapple, a tobongo can dig its spiky branches into its victim, infecting him with a foul and potent curse. Unless he succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save, the victim's flesh immediately begins to harden and grow uncontrollably like tree bark, and he takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage per day until his Dexterity reaches 0. At this point, the victim turns entirely stiff, grows roots, and transforms into a new, unintelligent tree, preventing any form of resurrection short of wish or miracle. The effect can be slowed by pruning the victim once per hour, slicing off the strange growths. Pruning inflicts 1d6 points of damage on the victim, but it negates the need to make a new Fortitude save. If the victim goes without pruning for more than an hour, the barkflesh takes over and he must immediately make the Fortitude save for the day or suffer the Dexterity damage. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Curse of Barkflesh: Grapple- injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d4 Dex damage, when Dex reaches 0, target transforms into a tree. Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A tobongo or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Shake the Earth (Ex) A rooted tobongo can, as a full-round action, uproot itself, buckling the surrounding earth in a 60-foot radius. Living creatures within the radius must make a DC 29 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d6 points of damage. Man-made structures within the area of effect must make a DC 29 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of structural damage. Once uprooted, the tobongo cannot use this action again until it re-roots itself. It takes the creature at least 1 hour to root effectively. The save DC is Strength-based.

This makes resurrecting such creatures difficult, but not impossible, requiring a true resurrection or greater spell, or a resurrection or similar spell cast directly on the spot where the creature died. Dirt or similar debris from the spot do not count as remains for the purpose of resurrection.

The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect.

As a swift action, a jinmenju can alter the appearance of any of its head-fruits to take on the particular face of any creature the tree has seen or has memory of. If it cannot determine what kind of face or form would be most appealing to a particular target by using its share memory spell-like ability, a jinmenju makes its head-fruit take the appearance of a delicious-looking melon. A jinmenju can alter its head-fruits into any combination of up to a maximum of six faces or shapes at one time. Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a head-fruit must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be magically compelled to immediately grab the head-fruit and eat it as soon as possible. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's enticing head-fruits for 24 hours. A head-fruit removed from a jinmenju's branch retains some of the tree's magic and maintains its shape for 1d3 hours before reverting to its natural form. The save DC is Constitution-based. In addition to tasting terrible, a jinmenju's head-fruits are incredibly poisonous, and anyone who takes a bite out of one suffers from the following effect.  Head-Fruit Poison: Head-fruit-ingested; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 round; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Intoxicating Stench (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a jinmenju can cause its fruit to immediately begin to ferment, emitting an unnaturally sweet aroma in a 60- foot spread that draws creatures toward the tree. Once activated, the aroma persists for 6 rounds unless dispersed by moderate or stronger wind. All creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each round or become captivated. Once a creature becomes captivated, it takes no actions save to approach the jinmenju via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim that is attacked by the jinmenju gets a new saving throw as a free action during each of the jinmenju's attacks to overcome the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.

When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown mold), a calathgar gains fast healing 1. Mold Mulch (Ex) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is killed by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet of brown mold is cold enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and the persistent effect of its seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. See page 416 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for additional details.

This attack instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.  Infestation (Su) A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot-square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on all Will saves made against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed.
